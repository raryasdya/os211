## 02. [Memory Management Glossary](https://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/index.html)

It's hard to learn every new word when you learn something new, including memory management. This interesting link is our solution since it provides us with every glossary that we need to know about memory management.



## 03. [Virtual Memory](https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-virtual-memory-gary-explains-747960/)

Virtual is a word we hear a lot these days. Before virtual reality and virtual currency there was virtual memory. It is a technology that you find in desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones. In this article, Gary explains about what is virtual memory and why is it important. This article is interesting because it also provides us some illustrations that help us understand about virtual memory.



## 04. [Demand Paging, Swapping, and Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)

This interesting article gives us proper explanation about virtual memory. Besides definition, this article also tells us about the advantages, causes of thrashing, and recovery of thrashing. Those things make this article more interesting.



## 05. [Demand-Paging and Pre-Paging](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-demand-paging-and-pre-paging)

Demand paging means we should not load any page into the main memory until required or we should keep all the pages in secondary memory until demanded. Meanwhile, Pre-Paging means the OS guesses in advance which page the process will require and pre-loads them into the memory. This article tells us only the important things about paging and that's what makes this article interesting.



## 06. [More About Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)

Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible. The article is interesting because it provides us with some illustrations.



## 07. [Caching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FyXURRVmR0)

Caches are used everywhere in many hardware components and throughout software. The goal of caching is to store data from slow memory into fast memory so it can be retrieved quicker. This video explains caching in the easy way with their interesting animation.



## 08. [Global vs Local Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)

The number of frames allocated to a process can also dynamically change depending on whether you have used global replacement or local replacement for replacing pages in case of a page fault. This article explains about frame allocation and the difference between global and local allocation. This article is interesting because it tells us about frame allocation in simple way.



## 09. [Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mycVSMyShk8)

This video tells us about Kernel. Kernel is responsible for low-level tasks such as disk management, memory management, task management. It provides an interface between the user and the hardware components of the system. The way the speaker, Gary, explains about Kernel is what makes this video interesting.



## 10. [Guide to Table of Processes](https://www.lifewire.com/linux-top-command-2201163)

Table of processes or top is a task manager program, found in many Unix-like operating systems, that displays information about CPU and memory utilization. There are many commands for top that you can find in this link. This link is interesting because it lists all of top's command.
