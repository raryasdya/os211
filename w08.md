# Top 10 Interesting Link of Week 08



## 1. [Overview of Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling)

Preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling are both CPU scheduling tehcnique that each has got their own benefit. This link is interesting because the article explains about those two in a simple way plus there's a comparison table.



## 2. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)

The previous link explains the overview about preemptive and non-pteemptive scheduling. But in this link,  the article explains it very thoroughly with detailed examples, advantages, and disadvantages. The illustrations that help them explain the examples are what make this link interesting.



## 3. [Comparison of Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/comparision-scheduling-algorithms)

CPU can apply different scheduling algorithms to schedule processes. This article covers the advantages and disadvantages of many scheduling algorithms. This link is interesting because the article's last section was "Usage of Scheduling Algorithms in Different Situations".



## 4. [Process Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html)

Process Scheduling is an OS task that schedules processes of different states like ready, waiting, and running. This interesting link explains about process scheduling very thoroughly, including type of process scheduling.



## 5. [Difference Between Process and Thread](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread.html)

Process is the execution of a program that allows you to perform the appropriate actions specified in a program and thread is an execution unit that is part of a process. A process can have multiple threads, all executing at the same time. This link is interesting because it explains about the difference between those two in a simple way and there's a comparison table.



## 6. [CPU-I/O Burst](https://qr.ae/pGnNP8)

A CPU bursts when it is executing instructions; an I/O system bursts when it services requests to fetch information. The link above is spesific to a certain answer that explains about burst. This particular answer is interesting because it manages to teach about burst in a simple way.



## 7. [Scheduling in Real-Time Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)

Real-time systems are systems that carry real-time tasks that need to be performed immediately with a certain degree of urgency. This link is interesting because it classifies scheduling algorithms based on schedulability, implementation (static or dynamic), and the result (self or dependent) of analysis.



## 8. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-scheduling/)

Scheduling of threads involves two boundary scheduling, scheduling of user level threads (ULT) to kernel level threads (KLT) via leightweight process (LWP) and scheduling of kernel level threads. This interesting article explains about thread scheduling very thoroughly.



## 9. [Multiple-Processor Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)

In multiple-processor scheduling multiple CPUâ€™s are available and hence Load Sharing becomes possible. This article explains about it pretty clearly. This link is interesting because it has got a good length of article, not too long but not too short either.



## 10. [Synchronization Problems](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/classical-synchronization-problems)

This article covers three synchronization problems, Bounded Buffer (Producer-Consumer), Dining Philosophers, and the Readers Writers. This link is interesting because it explains the three of them with clear points.
